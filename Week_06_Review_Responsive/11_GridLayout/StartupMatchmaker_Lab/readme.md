#FEWD Grid Layout: Member List

---


###Description

The Startup Matchmaker site needs a list of their member companies. They've already assembled a html + css template for each member company on the listing.

Plan to use the 960 grid system with a 12-across grid.


###Steps

* Connect the css files for startup matchmaker, the member company block, and the 960 grid.
* Use the 960 grid framework to center the header and the content header.  Add grid classes to extant tags where appropriate and add divs where needed.
* Use the grid framework to create a list of member companies where each row is 2 entries across.  This should go into the main content.  The content for the member companies is in member_blocks.html.  You will need to wrap these blocks in a grid structure.
* Use the grid framework to properly house the footer.
