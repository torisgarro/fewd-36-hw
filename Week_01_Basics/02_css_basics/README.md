__Part 1:__ 

Review answers to "What Tag Is It?" This is an opportunity to formally introduce the img tag and (including relative / absolute paths) nav tag. Also is a chance to review structure of an html file ```<html> /<html>, <body>, <!doctype>, head, meta, title``` This is also the time to add to students' understanding of the DOM.

	
__Part 2:__ 

Adding styling to your About me page. Note that the code introduces margin and padding. Next lesson, we will learn about the box model.

__Part 3:__

Add a link to the portfolio page. During lab time, add css to style the portfolio page. Remember to create a portfolio.html file with the students, as this is the first time they will see linking pages. This is also an opportunity to reiterate what was said about absolute and relative paths. During the lab time, students will complete any necessary styling and HTML for their resume page.

===

####Lab Time
_Time: 30min_

*	Time for students to apply what they learned. Setup lab time by letting students know how to start the exercise and what is expected of them. **Point out**: The portfolio page they will continue  building should be personalized and will reflect just a portion of the projects they will build throughout the course.  Look at this as a time to set goals and get students excited about what they will be building. 

####Your Portfolio 

|Exercise |[Solution File](../Assignment) |
|:------------- |:-------------|
| __Topics__ | html, css, linking pages|
